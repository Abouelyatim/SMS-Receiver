# SMS-Receiver

The principle of the application is as follows:

1. The user in the configuration chooses certain contacts.

2. As soon as it receives an SMS from one of these contacts, the application automatically responds to them by email.

3. Once the email is sent, the application displays a notification to the user that it has been done.
